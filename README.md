## Reflection
 
 Project goals included using technologies mainly react and reducx to build an app and familiarize the concepts learn so far.  
 I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `react-router-4.0` and `redux`.  

The main challenge was to understand the concept of react-redux really and applied to the project

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router, Redux and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup.
